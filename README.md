ODTÜVent - An expedition taken by engineering students to solve the COVID-19 Health Crisis.

Today, the medical world is facing a severe shortage of respirators that work properly to save as many human lives as possible. The COVID-19 pandemic will cause ventilator shortages and demand will increase 10 times of what’s available (Bloomberg). The production of conventional ventilators will likely fail to keep up with the demand and the prices will plummet. We are one of several teams who recognized these challenges. We, the ODTUVent team, started a project of building and producing a portable and compact artificial respiration device which is easily and cheaply reproduced while taking into account the medical needs of the current COVID-19 patients.
