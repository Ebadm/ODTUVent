# ODTUVent

## ODTÜVent - An expedition taken by engineering students to solve the COVID-19 Health Crisis.

## THE PROJECT
Today, the medical world faces a severe shortage of respirators that work properly to save as many human lives as possible. The COVID-19 pandemic will cause ventilator shortages and demand will increase 10 times of what’s available(Bloomberg). The production of conventional ventilators will likely fail to keep up with the demand and the prices will plummet. We are one of several teams who recognized these challenges. Since March 27th, we, the ODTUVent team, started a project of building and producing a portable and compact artificial respiration device which is easily and cheaply reproduced. We focused on keeping the design simple and are making use of the minimum possible material/components. After finishing our literature research and getting accustomed to the medical needs of current COVID-19 patients, we have come up with the design of the first version of our device to resolve this unfortunate crisis together. Finally, version 0 is not yet optimal; however, we hope, with your support, we can improve this further.

## What is ODTUVent?

“ODTUVent” is a device inspired by the bag-valve-mask ventilator that paramedics use when they’re manually ventilating patients in an ambulance. This allows control of respiration rate, tidal volume, pressure variance, and PEEP. The device is being developed as a global partnership for the greater good, in an open-source code mentality, on a non-profit basis to enable free and simple mass production by anyone, anywhere in the world. It is designed as an alternative automatic, controlled, ventilation system.

## Goal
The goal of this site is to provide the best information we can, focused on innovation, on automating a manual resuscitator, as a potential means for longer-term ventilation. This is a completely off-label use, but we recognize the global interest when a hospital has used up all ventilators and the only option is manually bagging a patient. We hope that such systems may serve as bridge devices and help with the triage of available respirators and clinicians trained in respiratory therapy. This may allow less severe patients to be cared for by less specialized clinicians, while resources are focused on those most in need. However, at no time should a patient be unattended without someone skilled available to directly monitor their vital signs. Effectively, we are reprising the early days of safe ventilation where direct clinical observation of patient condition served as the key feedback.

Begin by familiarizing yourselves with our team at About, then the detailed Clinical Report. This is critical to understand the logic underlying the current status of COVID-19 patients and their Respiratory Requirements. We have also posted our Contact Details in case you have any queries about our expedition.
