FIGURE.1: Our Mechanical Circuit

For a detailed primer on Breathing Circuits read Maplesonâ€™s Breathing Systems.

The reservoir bag is directly connected to the oxygen input from an oxygen reservoir. The gas then flows through the intake and reservoir valve, which insures that flow is only in one direction using the flap valve, and does not allow the pressure to exceed a certain value. This valve can also be replaced with a toilet seat valve in case not found.

The pressure guage allows manual measurement of the pressure of the air leaving the valve, this is for clinicians in case of emergencies. The patient, PEEP and pop off valve are all placed as close to the patient as possible to minimize the amount of dead volume. The patient valve is a one way valve which does not allow air to flow back into the bag. Directly connected to it is the PEEP and POP off valve. The HEPA filter follows next, and then finally an elbo which contains the pressure sensor used by the controller. A silicon mask is used on the patient.

The overall assembly without the tubing, filter and elbow is shown below. This can be used in case of failure and when manual ventilation is needed.
